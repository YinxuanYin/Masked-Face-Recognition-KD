### Abstract ###

The emergence of the global COVID-19 pandemic poses new challenges for biometrics. Not only are contactless
biometric identification options becoming more important, but face recognition has also recently been confronted with the
frequent wearing of masks. These masks affect the performance of previous face recognition systems, as they hide important identity information. In this paper, we propose a
mask-invariant face recognition solution (MaskInv) that utilizes template-level knowledge distillation within a training paradigm
that aims at producing embeddings of masked faces that are similar to those of non-masked faces of the same identities.
In addition to the distilled knowledge, the student network benefits from additional guidance by margin-based identity
classification loss, ElasticFace, using masked and non-masked faces. In a step-wise ablation study on two real masked
face databases and five mainstream databases with synthetic masks, we prove the rationalization of our MaskInv approach.
Our proposed solution outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) academic solutions in the recent MFRC-21 challenge
in both scenarios, masked vs masked and masked vs nonmasked, and also outperforms the previous solution on the
MFR2 dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed model can still perform well on unmasked faces with only a
minor loss in verification performance.
